# AUS Laban Up Quality Engineering

<p align="justify">
This immersive Virtual Reality (VR) experience is specifically tailored for industrial engineering students. It offers a practical and interactive way to understand and engage with the principles of quality process control in a simulated industrial environment. Please note that this GitHub repository does not contain the actual code for the project. Instead, it includes a brief description, key stages, and a recorded demo of the project. The code cannot be shared due to client confidentiality, but the demo video highlights my skills in creating VR apps.

## Key Stages 

### 1- Visual Inspection: 

   - <p align="justify"> Students are tasked with inspecting bottles on a conveyor belt. They must identify and sort faulty bottles, demonstrating their ability to discern quality standards effectively. </p>

### 2- Capacity Check:

   - <p align="justify"> Students engage in a sample selection process, requiring them to understand and apply basic concepts of multiplication and statistical analysis. This stage reveals the efficiency of the filling process and provides insights into potential machinery calibration issues. </p>

### 3- Packaging:

   - <p align="justify"> The final stage involves packaging the bottles in sets of six and preparing them for shipment. This stage emphasizes the importance of final quality checks and the logistics of product distribution. </p>

## Technologies

### 1- Unity 3D:

   - The core platform for developing the VR environment and interactions.

### 2- C#:

   - The primary programming language for scripting logic, interactions, and simulations.

### 3- XR Interaction Toolkit:
    
   - A framework for implementing VR interactions and controls.

### 4- Paid and Free Assets:

   - <p align="justify"> A combination of assets from the Unity Asset Store were used to enhance the visual and functional quality of the VR experience. </p>
